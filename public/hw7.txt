PHP and JavaScript are both languages for programing that are often used in web development. They are able to execute functions on both servers and clients, including submissions of data through forms and interaction with databases. Despite the differences, both languages cater to the creation of dynamic and interactive web pages. PHP is pre-eminently a server side scripting language, which is executed on the server before the HTML is sent to the designated browser, hence rendering it as a client side scripting language which is executed on the browser simultaneously. PHP is commonly used for server side-functions like server-logic and database interactions whereas the JavaScript is used for client side functions like document object manipulation and user interactions.
The Model presents the data and business logic, and it is responsible for such tasks as data storage, statistics distribution, and verification. The View is tasked with presenting information the way the user wants to see it thus taking the instructions from the Model and translating the them into the display element of the interface. The Controller performs mainly as a middleman entity between the Model and the View. He/she handles the user input, processing it, and eventually updates either the Model or the View. It has the program logic for common user activity line such as request handling and coordinating actions between the Model and View.
